    "# Full Stack Tutorial with Ember (JavaScript) and Django (Python)\n",
    "In 2019, many developers find themselves building applications using frontend JavaScript frameworks that query data from an API. One of those frontend frameworks is Ember.js, which comes batteries-included with routing, models, testing and an ecosystem of plugins and helpers. Django, a high-level MVC Python web framework, with the powerful toolkit Django Rest Framework (DRF), is a useful tool for powering API development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Michael Johnson will speak about Full Stack Web Development with Ember.js and Django in Python. This talk will cover high-level concepts about APIs, as well as low-level demonstration of code required to connect frontend to the backend. The final product will make client-side (browser) changes that will persist in a database through the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the Author\n",

    "## Return to Main Path: Our Flat JSON vs JSON-API Spec\n",
    "It's been mentioned that Ember uses JSON-API. We also installed Djagno Rest Framework JSON-API. However, our data currently is showing in our API as JSON. Let's take a brief second to discuss the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight for of data that is easy to read and write as humans. It has become widely accepted as a way to transfer data over the internet. It is based off the way we create objects in JavaScript with key/value pairs. The keys are string and the values can be strings, numbers, arrays, or even objects themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"key1\": \"value1\",\n",
    "    \"key2\": \"value2\",\n",
    "    \"id\": 32,\n",
    "    \"key_awesomeness\": \"my awesome value\"\n",
    "    \"properties\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"values\"]\n",
    "    \"related models\": {\n",
    "        \"apples\": \"nom nom\",\n",
    "        \"events\": \"tonight\",\n",
    "        \"users\": [\"Tommy\", \"Rakesh\", \"Aardvark\"]\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The flexibility of JSON is awesome as it allows you to structure data how you'd like. However, this flexibility also creates issues. I ask an API for data and receive a JSON, I may have no clue how it might be coming accross. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is where JSON-API Specification helps. It is a standardized approach to how JSON will be structured so the consumer always knows what to expect. As they say on [their website](https://jsonapi.org), \n",
    "\n",
    "> By following shared conventions, you can increase productivity, take advantage of generalized tooling, and focus on what matters: your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only does it help in teams to have an agreed convention, but Ember data expects JSON-API. So if we format our data fron Django according to this format, Ember can easily translate the data into Ember models with easy - no munging necessary! How cool is that?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Data on JSON-API\n",
    "The diference between JSON and JSON-API for our events model is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you don't see too drastic of a difference, JSON-API is especially important when models have related values and when we want (or don't want to) to retreive the related data when calling our endpoints. Unfortunately, demonstrating this is outside the scope of this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Side by Side comparison of JSON vs JSON API](static/json-vs-jsonapi.png \"Side by Side comparison of JSON vs JSON API\")\n",
    "\n",
    "While JSON-API is more verbose, the consisten structure and the information provided is much more useful for microservice communication.\n",
